This older project of mine was to practice with Python Data Science packages such as numpy and pandas. The work in this was directly created using google Colab, which is my Python notebook of choice

I was looking at anonymized facebooks ads data and trying to dissect it an a few different ways to see if I could find small correlations. This was very similar to some of the work that I would do as a Data Analyst working for a Digital Marketing back in 2020. Looking for correlations in data to help find insights and share with stake holders.
